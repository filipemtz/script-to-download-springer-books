| **Update (06 March 2021):** *In the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Springer released several technical books for free.  This script could be used to download all the books at the time. Since the books are not free anymore, the script is no longer useful.* |

# Script to Download the Books Release for Free by Springer [Discontinued]

Run with `python downloader.py`. 

The script only supports python 3. 

It will create a folder "books/" and subfolders for each subject.

The books will be downloaded as pdf files and stored in the respective subject folders.

Some of the released books are not available anymore. These books will be listed in a file called failures.csv.
